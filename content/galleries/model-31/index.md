Franklin-Christoph Model 31 in Italian Ice, with an F-C HPSteel
needlepoint nib (Nagahara, chop included).

Franklin-Christoph Model 31:
- with clip;
- in Italian Ice;
- with an F-C HPSteel needlepoint nib (Nagahara, chop included).


I've run a small dollop of ink through this pen using the converter.
Never been eye-dropper-ed.  It's only been used at my work-from-home
desk.  I'm grading it _A2_.

The nib is *very* fine and about just slightly drier than medium on
the wet/dry scale.

I bought several pens in a frenzy at the last (11/10/2020) "show
sale".  I'm selling it (along with a couple of others) because it's
not different enough from an Antique Glass pen that I already have.
It took me a while to get around to giving it a test drive and decide
to part with it.
