### Franklin-Christoph Model-20

Franklin-Christoph Model 20:
- with clip;
- in "Venetian Red SE"
- with an F-C HPSteel needlepoint nib (Nagahara, chop included).

I've run a small dollop of ink through this pen using the converter.
Never been eye-dropper-ed.  It's only been used at my work-from-home
desk.  I'm grading it _A2_.

The nib is *very* fine and about medium on the wet/dry scale.

I bought several pens in a frenzy at the last (11/10/2020) "show
sale".  I'm selling it (along with a couple of others) because it's
not different enough from a Model 20 I picked up at the 2016 (yeesh!)
SF Pen show.  It took me a while to get around to giving it a test
drive and decide to part with it.
